## Classes

### Scaler (BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin)

Extension of Scikit-learn's StandardScaler which allows scaling by different powers of the standard deviation.

#### Methods

<details>
<summary><code>__init__(scale_power, copy, with_mean, with_std)</code></summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>fit(X, y)</code></summary>

Compute the mean and standard deviation from a dataset to use in future scaling operations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>partial_fit(X, y)</code></summary>

Performs online computation of mean and standard deviation on X for later scaling.
All of X is processed as a single batch.
This is intended for cases when `fit` is
not feasible due to very large number of `n_samples`
or because X is read from a continuous stream.

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>transform(X, y, copy)</code></summary>

Perform standardization by centering and scaling using the parameters.

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>inverse_transform(X, copy)</code></summary>

Scale back the data to the original representation.
